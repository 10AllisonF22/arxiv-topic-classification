# arXiv Topic Classification using Machine Learning

This project explores topic classification of scientific papers using arXiv metadata.
Text abstracts are transformed using TF-IDF, followed by clustering and supervised
classification.

## Methods
- Text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction
- K-Means clustering with PCA visualization
- Supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Error analysis on misclassified samples

## Dataset
arXiv Metadata Dataset (Kaggle)
Due to size constraints, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

## Tools
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Author
